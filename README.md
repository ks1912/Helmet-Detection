# ABSTRACT 

We propose a machine for Detection of People and Motorcyclist who are not wearing helmet. The developed application aims to help law enforcement, and eventually resulting in changing risk behaviours and consequently reducing the number of accidents and its severity. 
We present a framework for automatic detection of motorcyclists driving without helmets and people working in construction sites without helmet in surveillance videos and images. Video frames recorded by the CCTV camera and pictures taken at the scene are used to detect people who are not wearing helmet. If any person without helmet is found, then image will be capture or a snap will be taken and image will be stored in the different database. 
The estimated results show that the developed program is able to detect 81% of motorcyclists on various motorcycle types. The validation results reveal that the program achieves 74% accuracy in detecting the people without helmet the given stats are came up in the testing phase.
